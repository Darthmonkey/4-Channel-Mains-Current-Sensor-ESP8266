# 4-Channel-Mains-Current-Sensor-ESP8266
A 4-Channel mains sensor with an option for either a Wemos D1 Mini or an ESP-12 WiFi module. This board uses the ESP8266's on-board A/D (12-bit) with an external multiplexer to select the channel to be read. 

Included is a basic Arduino sketch which reports the mV AC across the 22 ohm burden resistor.
